# Law-Test-Randomizer Application Audit (2025-11-05)

- **Overall Score:** 45 / 100
- **Reviewer:** Codex (GPT-5)  
- **Scope:** SvelteKit frontend, API proxy routes, lib utilities, data migrations, automated tests.

## Snapshot
- **Notable strengths**
  - Core teacher/student/reviewer flows are implemented end-to-end with previews, assignment, grading, and reviewing supported in the UI (`src/routes/+page.svelte:1`).
  - Client-side validation helpers reduce accidental bad input and are covered by unit tests (`src/lib/api.js:8`, `src/lib/api.spec.js:1`).
  - Server-backed sessions with http-only cookies and login rate limiting reduce credential exposure compared to the previous localStorage model (`src/lib/server/session.js:1`, `src/routes/api/auth/login/+server.js:1`, `src/lib/server/loginRateLimit.js:1`).
  - Unit test suite runs quickly and passes (`npm run test:unit -- --run`).
- **Top risks**
  - Server routes still build SQL through manual string interpolation, leaving room for injection if validation ever slips (`src/routes/api/tests/upload/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/tests/[id]/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/auth/signup/+server.js:1`). Adopt parameterised queries or a query builder across the server codebase.
  - Session adoption is incomplete: most protected endpoints still trust `teacherId` provided in request bodies instead of deriving identity from the authenticated session, enabling privilege escalation (`src/routes/api/tests/assign/+server.js:22`, `src/routes/api/tests/upload/+server.js:66`).
  - Dormant accounts remain unhashed until re-login and no password policies exist, so stolen dumps are still valuable despite hashing and rate limiting (`src/routes/api/auth/login/+server.js:1`, `src/lib/server/pin.js:1`).

## Security (critical risks)
- **Client-managed SQL with exposed credentials (mitigated 2025-11-07).** SvelteKit no longer exposes the generic `/api/query` and `/api/query-file` proxies; all raw SQL now executes from server routes using the private service token (`src/routes/tests/[id]/+page.server.js:1`, `src/routes/+page.server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/tests/[id]/+server.js:1`, `src/lib/api.js:1`). *Follow-up:* scrub documentation and tooling that referenced the old endpoints and ensure administrators only run migrations through secured server processes.
- **Server-side SQL string building.** Even with the browser proxy removed, server handlers still compose SQL with string concatenation (`src/routes/api/tests/upload/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/tests/[id]/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/auth/signup/+server.js:1`). Rigorous validation reduces risk, but parameterised queries would close the gap. *Action:* introduce a safe query builder or parameter binding in the backend helper and migrate high-risk endpoints first.
- **Backend token fallback (addressed 2025-11-06).** The env helper now fails fast when `BACKEND_SERVICE_TOKEN` is missing and ignores the deprecated `PUBLIC_PASSPHRASE` variable (`src/lib/server/env.js:1`). *Action:* audit deployment manifests to ensure the private token is set everywhere and remove legacy env vars to avoid confusion.
- **Partial server-side ownership checks.** High-risk teacher routes now resolve identity from the authenticated session via `resolveTeacherId` (`src/lib/server/authGuard.js:1`), covering assignments, uploads, grading, results, teacher test listings, and question loading. Class roster queries also enforce session-derived identity (`src/routes/api/classes/students/+server.js:1`, `src/lib/api.js:218`). Many admin/reviewer flows still trust `teacherId` in payloads. *Action:* extend the session guard across the remaining endpoints and stop accepting client-supplied identifiers.
- **Arbitrary SQL console.** The admin page exposes a raw SQL console to any teacher (`src/routes/admin/+page.svelte:159`). Combined with exposed credentials, this is equivalent to full database compromise. *Action:* Remove or heavily restrict this console, limiting it to vetted read-only diagnostics behind admin-only auth.
- **Weak credentials & storage (partially addressed).** Auth endpoints hash PINs, auto-upgrade legacy values, and now enforce brute-force throttling plus http-only cookie sessions (`src/routes/api/auth/login/+server.js:1`, `src/lib/server/loginRateLimit.js:1`, `src/lib/server/session.js:1`, `migrations/013_add_auth_security.sql:1`). Dormant accounts remain unhashed until activity, there are no password strength requirements, and most APIs still trust client-supplied IDs. *Action:* backfill hashes for inactive accounts, migrate to stronger credentials, and require session-derived identity on every server mutation.
- **Client identity parameters linger.** Teacher dashboards no longer send `teacherId` when uploading, assigning, deleting, grading, or viewing results—the server resolves ownership from the authenticated session (`src/lib/api.js:1`, `src/routes/+page.svelte:1`, `src/routes/api/tests/[id]/questions/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/results/teacher/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/attempts/[attemptId]/answers/+server.js:1`). Reviewer/admin tooling still accepts explicit IDs. *Action:* finish removing identity parameters from reviewer and admin APIs so the session stays the sole source of authority.

## Usability
- **Overloaded home dashboard.** All teacher, student, assignment, review, and image workflows live on one giant page with dozens of toggles (`src/routes/+page.svelte:1`). This produces cognitive overload and makes discoverability poor. *Recommendation:* Split flows into focused routes (e.g., “Upload Tests”, “Assign Students”, “Review Submissions”) with guided navigation.
- **High-friction data entry.** Teachers must paste CSV-like text into a textarea (`src/routes/+page.svelte:213`) with limited inline validation or error surfacing. When parsing fails, errors are logged to the console rather than surfaced clearly. *Recommendation:* Provide drag-and-drop CSV upload with real-time validation summaries.
- **Admin workflows lack affordances.** The admin page expects teachers to remember IDs and PINs (`src/routes/admin/+page.svelte:26`) and exposes destructive actions without confirmation beyond `confirm()`. *Recommendation:* Add search, sorting, and explicit confirmation modals with contextual help.
- **Accessibility gaps.** Custom controls lack ARIA labelling and keyboard focus management in several components (e.g., modal toggles in `src/routes/+page.svelte:325`). *Recommendation:* Audit with axe or Lighthouse and add semantic roles/labels.

## Code Quality & Maintainability
- **Monolithic client API.** `src/lib/api.js` carries 600+ lines of mixed concerns (validation, SQL construction, business rules, randomisation). This impairs reuse and review. *Recommendation:* Split into domain-focused modules (tests, attempts, reviews) and push SQL construction server-side.
- **Console noise in server code.** Server load functions emit verbose emoji logging (`src/routes/tests/[id]/+page.server.js:3`) that will flood production logs. *Recommendation:* Replace with structured logging behind a debug flag.
- **Duplicated parsing logic.** CSV parsing is duplicated in both client (`src/routes/+page.svelte:184`) and server (`src/routes/api/tests/upload/+server.js:13`) with slightly diverging behaviour, increasing bug risk. *Recommendation:* Centralise parsing in a shared module.
- **Implicit dependencies.** Several functions require globals like `crypto` and `FormData` (e.g., `src/lib/api.js:454`) which fail in SSR contexts. *Recommendation:* Inject dependencies or guard for environment to avoid brittle runtime errors.

## Performance & Reliability
- **Unbounded data fetches.** Admin dashboards fetch all teachers, tests, and students without pagination (`src/routes/admin/+page.svelte:193`), which will degrade as data grows. *Recommendation:* Add server-side filtering and paging.
- **N+1 image requests.** `processQuestionsWithImagesOptimized` downloads each referenced image individually for every test load (`src/routes/tests/[id]/+page.server.js:44`). Large tests will incur long load times. *Recommendation:* Precompute resolved templates or batch image metadata server-side.
- **No failure handling for remote API.** Proxy routes assume the Railway backend is always up; failures surface as raw error strings in the UI. *Recommendation:* Add retries, timeouts, and user-friendly error states.

## Testing & Tooling
- **Unit tests exist but lack coverage of critical paths.** Tests cover utility functions but not security boundaries or server routes (`src/lib/api.spec.js:1`, `src/lib/user.spec.js:1`). There are no integration tests around login, uploads, or reviewer flows. *Recommendation:* Add Playwright smoke tests for each role and server-side API contract tests.
- **Linting currently fails.** `npm run lint` reports prettier violations across key files (`src/routes/+page.svelte:1`, `src/routes/tests/[id]/+page.server.js:1`). *Recommendation:* Enforce formatting in CI to catch drift.
- **No CI guidance.** README still mirrors the Svelte starter and omits auth/secrets setup, making onboarding uncertain (`README.md:1`). *Recommendation:* Document environment variables, migrations, and test data setup.

## Recommended Next Steps
1. **Harden server-side SQL execution.** Add parameter binding to `runQuery`/`runQueryFile`, refactor the highest-risk endpoints away from string interpolation, and add tests to guard against regression.
2. **Complete the authentication hardening.** Backfill hashes for dormant users, add password policies, continue rolling the session guard across every endpoint, and remove client-supplied identity parameters from API payloads.
3. **Refactor the UI into dedicated flows.** Break the monolithic dashboard apart, prioritising clarity for teachers, students, and reviewers.
4. **Stabilise tooling.** Fix lint/format drift, add CI, and expand automated tests around the highest-risk paths.
5. **Plan a security hardening sprint.** Run threat modelling, add monitoring, and conduct penetration testing before onboarding more users.

## Remediation Log
- 2025-11-04 — Backend bearer token moved to private env with shared DB helper (`src/lib/server/env.js:1`, `src/lib/server/db.js:1`). `/api/auth` endpoints now handle login & signup so the client never sees the token (`src/routes/api/auth/login/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/auth/signup/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/login/+page.svelte:1`). Docs and scripts updated to require `BACKEND_SERVICE_TOKEN` instead of the public token (`README.md:88`, `docs/testing.md:33`, `package.json:15`).
- 2025-11-04 — Teacher test assignment, activation, grading, and student/teacher results now flow through dedicated server endpoints with ownership checks (`src/routes/api/tests/assign/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/tests/active/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/results/teacher/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/attempts/[attemptId]/answers/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/attempts/answers/grade/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/results/student/+server.js:1`). Client helpers updated to hit these endpoints and pass teacher context (`src/lib/api.js:94`, `src/lib/api.js:105`, `src/lib/api.js:140`, `src/lib/api.js:155`, `src/lib/api.js:172`, `src/lib/api.js:202`), and the dashboard consumes the new response shapes (`src/routes/+page.svelte:705`). Unit tests adjusted to cover the new REST calls (`src/lib/api.spec.js:88`).
- 2025-11-04 — Removed the admin "Database Query Panel" to stop teachers from executing arbitrary SQL from the browser (`src/routes/admin/+page.svelte:1`). Risk mitigated while we replace remaining admin workflows with scoped server endpoints.
- 2025-11-04 — Migrated admin teacher/student/reviewer flows onto `/api/admin` server routes, replacing client-originated SQL (`src/routes/api/admin/teachers/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/admin/students/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/admin/tests/copy/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/admin/classes/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/admin/reviewers/+server.js:1`, `src/lib/api.js:643`). Admin UI now consumes REST payloads and refreshes lists without exposing the bearer token (`src/routes/admin/+page.svelte:1`), and unit coverage guards the new endpoints (`src/lib/api.spec.js:166`).
- 2025-11-04 — Image library CRUD moved to protected server endpoints with teacher-scoped headers (`src/routes/api/admin/images/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/admin/images/[id]/+server.js:1`). Client utilities and ImageManager now use the REST API (`src/lib/api.js:818`, `src/lib/components/ImageManager.svelte:1`, `src/routes/admin/+page.svelte:326`), closing the last major direct SQL pathway in the admin UI.
- 2025-11-04 — Reviewer invite management now runs through server routes (`src/routes/api/admin/reviewer-invitations/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/reviewers/+server.js:1`); the client fetches active reviewers and invitations via REST (`src/lib/api.js:681`, `src/lib/api.js:749`) and ReviewAssignment loads the new payloads (`src/lib/components/ReviewAssignment.svelte:19`). Added tests to cover the new fetch contracts (`src/lib/api.spec.js:200`).
- 2025-11-04 — Review assignment creation, dashboards, and feedback submission now rely on REST endpoints (`src/routes/api/review-assignments/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/reviewer-assignments/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/reviewer-reviews/[id]/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/review-assignments/[id]/results/+server.js:1`). Teacher and reviewer clients consume the new responses (`src/lib/api.js:1130`, `src/routes/+page.svelte:500`, `src/lib/components/ReviewerDashboard.svelte:1`), with Vitest coverage locking in the request shapes (`src/lib/api.spec.js:230`).
- 2025-11-04 — Teacher test/question management now uses scoped endpoints for class rosters, invites, active tests, and inline question editing (`src/routes/api/classes/students/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/classes/join/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/tests/active/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/tests/[id]/questions/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/questions/[id]/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/choices/[id]/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/tests/teacher/[id]/+server.js:1`). The dashboard and editor call these APIs (`src/routes/+page.svelte:440`, `src/routes/tests/[id]/+page.svelte:112`), and unit tests cover the new contracts (`src/lib/api.spec.js:240`).
- 2025-11-04 — Public signup and login now flow exclusively through `/api/auth` with invitation handling, removing client-side SQL for account creation (`src/routes/api/auth/signup/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/auth/login/+server.js:1`). Client helpers and the login page submit to the REST API (`src/lib/api.js:520`, `src/routes/login/+page.svelte:1`), and new Vitest cases assert the payloads (`src/lib/api.spec.js:360`).
- 2025-11-04 — Student attempt lifecycle moved to server routes for start/save/submit, preventing tampering with SQL (`src/routes/api/attempts/start/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/attempts/[id]/answer/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/attempts/[id]/submit/+server.js:1`). Client code now hits these endpoints (`src/lib/api.js:380`, `src/routes/tests/[id]/+page.svelte:58`), with unit coverage verifying the new contracts (`src/lib/api.spec.js:180`).
- 2025-11-05 — Added `auth_sessions` and `auth_login_limits` tables to support server-issued sessions and lockouts (`migrations/013_add_auth_security.sql:1`). Login flow now sets signed http-only cookies, records session usage, and clears failures on success (`src/routes/api/auth/login/+server.js:1`, `src/lib/server/session.js:1`). Logout endpoint and hooks clear cookies and tear down server state (`src/routes/api/auth/logout/+server.js:1`, `src/hooks.server.js:1`).
- 2025-11-06 — Removed the deprecated `PUBLIC_PASSPHRASE` fallback so deployments fail fast without `BACKEND_SERVICE_TOKEN` (`src/lib/server/env.js:1`). Introduced `resolveTeacherId` and updated teacher-sensitive routes to derive identity from authenticated sessions rather than request bodies (`src/lib/server/authGuard.js:1`, `src/routes/api/tests/assign/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/tests/upload/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/tests/[id]/questions/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/tests/teacher/[id]/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/results/teacher/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/attempts/[attemptId]/answers/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/attempts/answers/grade/+server.js:1`).
- 2025-11-07 — Eliminated the `/api/query` and `/api/query-file` proxies, routing SQL exclusively through authenticated server code (`src/routes/tests/[id]/+page.server.js:1`, `src/routes/+page.server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/tests/[id]/+server.js:1`). The client SDK now calls the new cascade delete endpoint and no longer exposes raw SQL helpers (`src/lib/api.js:1`, `src/lib/api.spec.js:1`).
- 2025-11-08 — Class roster API now rejects client-supplied teacher identifiers and relies on the signed session; the frontend helper and dashboard were updated accordingly (`src/routes/api/classes/students/+server.js:1`, `src/lib/api.js:218`, `src/routes/+page.svelte:457`, `src/lib/api.spec.js:387`).
- 2025-11-09 — Teacher dashboards dropped the remaining `teacherId` payloads for uploads, assignments, deletions, question fetch, grading, and results. Server endpoints now tolerate missing IDs and resolve ownership from the authenticated session, and the client SDK/tests reflect the new contract (`src/lib/api.js:1`, `src/lib/api.spec.js:1`, `src/routes/+page.svelte:1`, `src/lib/components/ReviewAssignment.svelte:1`, `src/routes/api/results/teacher/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/tests/[id]/questions/+server.js:1`, `src/routes/api/attempts/[attemptId]/answers/+server.js:1`).
